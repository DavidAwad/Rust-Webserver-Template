#Rust Webserver Template

So I've been messing around with Rust for the past few days and I really like it. 

This is a simple tutorial and boilerplate to get you started using Rust as a webserver, as it's REALLY fast at handling requests concurrently. 


Try it out! 

So the web framework being used here is called Iron. It's an awesome web framework for rust. 

If you have never used it or don't have it installed use this script to install the latest version.


```shell
$ curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh
```

Rust is currently at release 1.0.0 Beta, so you might want to run this occassionally as Rust is being updated a good bit.
